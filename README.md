# Module 3: PyPoll with Python (Election Analysis)

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the
following task to complete the election of a recent local cogresssional election.
1. Total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Total number of votes each candidate received
4. Percentage of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.9.1, Visual Code 1.5.2

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- The candidates were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
  - Candidate Charles Casper Stockham received "23.0%" of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
  - Candidate Diana DeGette received "73.8%" of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
  - Candidate Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the voite and "11,606" number of votes.
 - The winner fo the election was:
  - Candidate Diana DeGette who received 73.8% of the vote and "272,892" of votes.
 
##  Challenge Overview
This challenge has allowed us to get acquainted to the portion of Python that deals with Data Analysis.
A lot to learn and discover. I am more motivated to accumulate more knowledge about Python and other tools.

##  Challenge summary
By working with the raw data, presented to us, we have been able to infer the winner of the election. More importantly,
we have uncovered the concentration of the votes. In Denver. One can deduct that any candidate that does well in Denver, 30% or above
will never loose the election.
A copy of the results of the elections in Colorado clearly shows this observation. [Colorado Election Results (Python Challenge]([election_results.txt](https://github.com/RichardYDepestre/Election_Analysis/files/6072260/election_results.txt)
