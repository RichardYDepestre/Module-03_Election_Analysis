##  Challenge Overview
This challenge has allowed us to get acquainted to the portion of Python that deals with Data Analysis.
A lot to learn and discover. I am more motivated to accumulate more knowledge about Python and other tools.

##  Challenge summary
By working with the raw data, presented to us, we have been able to infer the winner of the election. More importantly,
we have uncovered the concentration of the votes. In Denver. One can deduct that any candidate that does well in Denver, 30% or above
will never loose the election.
A copy of the results of the elections in Colorado clearly shows this observation. [Colorado Election Results (Python Challenge]([election_results.txt](https://github.com/RichardYDepestre/Election_Analysis/files/6072260/election_results.txt)
